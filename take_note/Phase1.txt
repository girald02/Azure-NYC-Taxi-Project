Data architecture
using tools

HTTP api (parquet file )- DATA FACTORY - DATA LAKE (Bronze layer) - DATABRICKS (SILVER LAYER) - DATALAKE (SILVER LAYAER) - DATALATE USING DELTA LAKE (GOLD LAYER) - REPORT POWER BI

Security manage

to handle the HTTP parquet file dynamically i implement foreach loop that will get the dynamically month of each raw file in the based url.
i've uset(d an parameterize data using "@{datase).p_month}" 

Forache - sequential check box

insside the loop the copy data is there so that if the forach run it will automatically increament the number based on the data set i've provide dynamic content:
@item()


if condition expression:
@greater(@item() , 9) 

then i expose in if condition whenever theres a condition on pipeline that needed.

instead of creating a lot of copy data which is not sustainable being an efficeint data engineer.
